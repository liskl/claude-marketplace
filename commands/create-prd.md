# Create PRD

A conversational flow that transforms ideas (rough or detailed) into structured PRDs that serve as source of truth across sessions.

## What This Command Does

1. Assesses input fidelity (rough idea → detailed spec)
2. Adapts depth accordingly — more discovery for rough, faster structuring for detailed
3. Collaboratively shapes and battletests the concept
4. Generates a structured PRD with consistent sections
5. Outputs in chosen format (Obsidian-optimized or plain markdown)

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Cluttered PRDs that cause context drift. Keep it focused.

---

## Flow

### Phase 1: Input & Fidelity Detection

Start with:

```
What are you building? Share as much or as little as you have.

- Rough idea? I'll help you shape it.
- Some details already? I'll help structure and battletest.
- Detailed spec? I'll validate and format.
```

**After their response, assess fidelity:**

| Fidelity | Signals | Adapt |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Rough** | Vague goal, no features, "I want something for X" | More discovery questions, brainstorm together |
| **Medium** | Has goal + some features, maybe references | Clarifying questions, then structure |
| **Detailed** | Clear scope, stages defined, specific features | Light validation, jump to structuring |

Confirm:
```
This sounds like a [rough idea / medium-fidelity concept / detailed spec].
I'll [help you shape it / clarify and structure / validate and format].
Sound right?
```

### Phase 2: Discovery & Brainstorm

**For rough/medium fidelity:**

```
Let's shape this. Tell me:

1. What problem does this solve? Who feels the pain?
2. What do you already know? Any prior thinking?
3. Any external references? (codebases, docs, demos, similar projects)
4. What does success look like? (rough is fine)
```

Ask follow-ups to understand:
- Core value proposition
- Key constraints or requirements
- What's explicitly OUT of scope

**For detailed fidelity:** Skip or streamline — they've already thought this through.

### Phase 3: Battletest

Before structuring, stress-test:

```
Let me battletest this:

- What could go wrong?
- What's the riskiest assumption?
- Is the scope realistic?
- What's the MVP vs. the full vision?
```

Surface gaps, challenge assumptions, refine scope together.

### Phase 4: Structure

Apply the template, populating from the conversation:

**Core sections (always include):**

1. **Overview** — Problem, solution, target user (1-2 paragraphs)
2. **Problem** — What's broken, with evidence or examples
3. **Solution** — Concise answer, core insight
4. **Scope** — In scope / Out of scope (or Doing / NOT doing)
5. **Success Criteria / Stages** — v0, v1, etc. with clear boundaries
6. **Open Questions** — Unknowns to resolve
7. **Next Steps** — Actionable items, current status
8. **Session Handoff** — For cross-session pickup

**Optional sections (as needed):**
- Technical Details / Architecture
- Data Model
- Stack Decision (with rationale)
- Related projects / references

### Phase 5: Output Format

```
What format do you need?

1. Obsidian-optimized → Frontmatter + wiki-links + vault destination
2. Plain markdown → Clean, portable, no Obsidian-specific syntax
```

**If Obsidian:** Ask for vault path / PRD destination folder

### Phase 6: Generate & Review

Generate the full PRD and show it:

```
Here's your PRD. Review it:

[Full PRD content]

What would you like to do?
1. Ship it! → I'll save it now
2. Refine... → Tell me what to adjust
3. Show raw → Display for copying
```

## Output Templates

### Obsidian-Optimized Template

```markdown
---
created: [date]
type: prd
status: draft
related:
  - "[[Related Project]]"
tags:
  - [relevant tags]
---

# [Project Name] PRD

## Overview

[1-2 paragraphs: problem, solution, target user]

---

## Problem

[What's broken, evidence, concrete examples]

---

## Solution

[Concise answer, core insight]

---

## Scope

### In Scope (v0)
- [ ] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2

### Out of Scope
- Not doing X
- Deferred: Y

---

## Success Criteria

| Stage | Scope | "Done" when... |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| v0 | MVP | [criteria] |
| v1 | Enhanced | [criteria] |

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Question 1
- [ ] Question 2

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Immediate action 1
- [ ] Immediate action 2

---

## Session Handoff

- **Last updated:** [date]
- **Current status:** [where we are]
- **Blockers:** [if any]
- **Next session should:** [specific first action]

---

<!-- Generated by /create-prd -->
```

### Plain Markdown Template

Same structure, but:
- No YAML frontmatter
- Standard markdown links instead of `[[wiki-links]]`
- No Obsidian-specific syntax

---

## Design Principles

1. **Meet them where they are** — Adapt to input fidelity
2. **Collaborative, not extractive** — Shape ideas together, don't just capture
3. **Battletest before structuring** — Challenge assumptions early
4. **Source of truth** — PRD should enable cross-session pickup
5. **Avoid clutter** — Focused PRD prevents context drift
6. **Living document** — Built to be updated with progress, findings, blockers

---

## Notes

- Part of the [[Claude Metaskills]] family
- Pairs well with `/skill-builder` for packaging expertise
- Update PRDs during implementation sessions — they're living documents
- Session Handoff section is key for multi-session projects

<!--
Why this is a slash command (not a skill):
- Explicitly invoked (user decides to create a PRD)
- Linear flow with single output artifact
- No auto-triggering needed

See /skill-builder for decision logic.
